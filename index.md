I'm Kevin, a software developer with 3+ years experience in managing highly scalable backend systems. 

I previously worked at **Tesla** as part of the digital products team. There I worked on the process automation software to support the battery, energy and charging products.

[Pokebin](https://pokebin.app/) is an ecommerce app I built to sell various collectibles like pokemon cards.
I built the app using **Django** as the backend frameworks, **PostgresSQL** for the database and **S3** for object storage.
